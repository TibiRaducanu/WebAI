Nim game rules:
 - Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing (i.e., nimming) objects from distinct heaps or piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap/pile. Depending on the version being played, the goal of the game is either to avoid taking the last object, or to take the last object.
